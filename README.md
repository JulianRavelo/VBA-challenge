# VBA-challenge
## Description 
I was given a .xlsx file with details of stock markets movements per month for different tickers between 2018 and 2020. I was asked to create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:  
-The ticker symbol  
-Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.  
-The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.  
-The total stock volume of the stock.  

Additionally, as a bonus task, I was asked to add a functionality to my script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".  
The spreadsheet has 1 button called Create summary. It will create the summary table and bonus table for each sheet of the book.
